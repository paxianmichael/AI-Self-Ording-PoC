  ## Meeting:
    - Upcoming meeting 5/12 4pm EST
      - goal:
        - 1. using burger king dataset to try out different new releasing llm model from google, amazon and ... etc with a short written report to describe the pros and cons of the new releasing

        - 2. build an end-to-end prototype with burger king dataset as an example(try to see if it can order in a natural way)
    
    * improvements:
      - json format output integration
      
      - research download into local amazon lex
      
      - chila-f-la authorized dataset
      
      - upload amazon lex info into github
